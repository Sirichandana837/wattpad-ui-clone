'𝐁𝐞𝐚𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐮𝐥 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 : 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐋𝐢𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧' or may be love. She was led astray by him but still she fell more and more madly for him. 
<br><br>
I saw a man was brutally stabbing two people one by one on the road. He killed two people in front of my eyes. Seeing this horrifying sight before my eyes, my soul trembled, my body became cold as if I was not alive.
<br><br>
There were some men around him, but no one was even trying to stop him. Who is this man and why is he killing them so brutally?
<br><br>
And suddenly he stabbed his victim right in the middle of the neck, seeing which I screamed, "Ahhhh!"
<br><br>
It was going to prove to be my biggest mistake, he turned his gaze towards me and stood up from his place.
<br><br>
He started moving towards me while wielding the knife. It seemed as if I had become frozen, neither was I able to move nor was I able to react. His hands were stained with blood, there were blood stains on his face too.
<br><br>
He was slowly taking his steps towards me, but I was not able to even move from my place. I could clearly see my death in his scarier eyes. I understood that within a few moments I too would meet the same fate as those two people.
<br><br>
As soon as he reached me, he extended his blood soaked hand towards me, I was scared to death and immediately took a few steps back. He smirked and took as many steps forward. He extended his hand towards me again and said softly in his heavy voice, "Will you marry me?"
