        <p>
            Samhita Maity, a historian, found excitement in discovering long-lost secrets of histories- a perfectionist in her work. 
<br><br>
However, there was one mysterious figure eluding her expertise-the exploration of the most celebrated king of ancient India, whose name resounded across the world. His unwritten and unfinished books ignited her curiosity, and day and night, her thoughts were consumed by him. 
<br><br>
Who was he beyond the exterior of a king? How did his empire attain such advanced and flourishing heights that even contemporary science couldn't reach? Why were only fragments written about him? Where did he vanish so suddenly?
<br><br>
These questions lingered, morphing into an obsession.
<br><br>
Driven by an insatiable desire to unravel his mystery, Samhita set on a daring journey through time, stepping into his kingdom. 
<br><br>
As the threads of time intertwined, Samhita became Rajadhiraj Vikramaditya's own obsession. She had entered the realm of an eagle, and now, there seemed to be no escape.
<br><br>
Would she find her way back to her own time? Would he permit her departure or would she be held captive by the sparks of dominance and power that crackled between them? Could their individual dominances coexist, or would they crumble in the face of each other's compelling forces?</p>
