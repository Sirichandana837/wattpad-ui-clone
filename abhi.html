        <p>
I never imagine in my dreams that i'll loose my only family my brother 
<br><br>
Emotions and blood have that sacred bond that the thickness of blood matters on the emotions running through the nerves. 
<br><br>
Mine was the hatred, pure revange, and his was the love, deep love
<br><br>
I'll never forgot the man who took my only family, so i'll take his!
<br><br>
I want to rage a war against the prince of malbargarh, soley me and him, even when going opposite to the laws
<br><br>
Let's dive into the stroy of abhsree and Rajanandan
